# Puplympics
Schoolrunner School Happiness Engineer Technical Task

Part 1:
	Butter is the winning Pup, traveling a total of 4248 feet in 3461 seconds.  Congratulations!

Part 2:

	I was unable to complete the challenge.  I have pseudocoded what I imagined would work, but was hung up on the foreach loop for a multidimensional array.  Lots of checks for each second.

Built using PHP. 

Development using MAMP to run on localhost:8888.
